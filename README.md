# Hextech

A Python framework for accessing League of Legends esports data. 
This package uses data from [Leaguepedia](https://lol.gamepedia.com/) and Riot's [Data Dragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon) API. It does not require the use of a Riot API key.

## Installation

With [pip](https://pypi.org/project/Hextech/):

`pip install hextech`

## Usage

Here is a basic example of using hextech to print all game results in LCK 2020 Summer split.

~~~
import hextech

tournament = hextech.getTournaments()["LKC 2020 Summer"]
matches = tournament.getMatches()
for match in matches:
	games = match.getGames()
	for game in games:
		print(game)
~~~

Objects of the following classes are meant to be read-only; they are automatically instantiated by methods such as tournament.getMatches() and match.getGames().
